\chapter{Written communication with LaTeX}\label{written-communication-with-latex}}

This document is designed to help you get started with using LaTeX, it supports the labs for the first year undergraduate course in Computer Science, \href{https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus}{COMP101}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/1000px-LaTeX_project_logo_bird.svg}

LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. \citep{latexproject} It is most often used for technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing, including writing CVs and formal letters. Whatever documents you create with LaTeX, one of its key strengths is making them look professional in portable document format (pdf) using industrial strength typesetting.

\hypertarget{not-a-word-processor}{%
\section{Not a word processor}\label{not-a-word-processor}}

LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages you not to worry too much about the appearance of your documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. This is similar to the approach you've been using for creating web pages where the style (CSS) is sepereated from the contents (HTML).

Reading this LaTeX guide and doing the five exercises it contains will enable you to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a simple document in pdf using LaTeX
\item
  Illustrate a document with figures and cross references
\item
  Typeset some mathematics
\item
  Save and share LaTeX documents using overleaf
\item
  Create a CV using LaTeX templates in overleaf
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{acknowledgements}{%
\section{Acknowledgements}\label{acknowledgements}}

This document is a substantially revised version of earlier LaTeX lab manuals created by Ulrike Sattler, Graham Gough, Paul Waring, Toby Howard and Steve Pettifer.

\hypertarget{simples}{%
\chapter{Simple LaTeX documents}\label{simples}}

We'll start by creating a simple LaTeX document.

\hypertarget{shortest}{%
\section{The shortest document possible}\label{shortest}}

Open up your favourite editor, enter the following text, then save it as a file called \texttt{turing.tex}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}documentclass}\NormalTok{[a4paper]\{}\ExtensionTok{article}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{Computational excursions}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To turn this into a PDF we need to use a LaTeX compiler, we're going to use \texttt{pdflatex}, though several other compeilers are available.\footnote{\url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler}} The \texttt{pdflatex} compiler is already installed on the Linux VM image for VirtualBox.\footnote{\url{https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/CSImage_VM}} For other operating systems you'll need to explore the options at \href{https://www.latex-project.org/get/}{latex-project.org/get}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# compile turing.tex}
\NormalTok{pdflatex turing.tex}
\CommentTok{\# open the pdf output}
\NormalTok{xdg}\OperatorTok{{-}}\NormalTok{open turing.pdf}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first command outputs a pdf file from your TeX input using the \texttt{pdflatex} compiler. The second command opens the file you've created. If you list the directory contents, you'll see that the compiler has also created an auxillary \texttt{*.aux} file and a \texttt{*.log} log file which can be helpful for debugging the compilation of more complicated documents:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# files created on compilation}
\NormalTok{turing.tex}
\NormalTok{turing.pdf}
\NormalTok{turing.aux}
\NormalTok{turing.log}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{longer}{%
\section{A longer LaTeX document}\label{longer}}

Our turing.tex file is a very simple document, so let's add some sections and fill them out a bit:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}documentclass}\NormalTok{[a4paper]\{}\ExtensionTok{article}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}


\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Algorithms: Cooking Up Programs\}}
\NormalTok{A program specifies in the }\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}textbf}\NormalTok{\{exact syntax\} of some programming language the computation one expects a computer to perform. The syntax is precise and unforgiving. The slightest error in the program as written may cause the computation to be in error or may halt altogether. The reason for this situation seems paradoxical on the surface: It is relatively easy to design a system that converts rigid syntax to computations; it is much harder to design a system that tolerates mistakes or accepts a broader range of program descriptions.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Finite automata: The Black Box\}}
\NormalTok{It occasionally happens in industrial, military or educational settings that one is presented with a piece of electronic hardware whose exact function is uncertain or unknown. One way of discovering how the device works is to take it apart, piece by piece, and deduce its function by analysing the components and their interconnections. This is not always possible, however, nor is it always necessary. Given that the mystery machine has both input and output facilities, it may be possible to discover what it does without ever taking it apart. Since its appearance gives no clue about its function, we call it a }\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}textit}\NormalTok{\{black box\}.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Systems of Logic: Boolean Bases\}}
\NormalTok{In an age of computers and automation, almost every electronic device one can name incorporates at least one boolean function. For example, many current models of automobile will emit a high{-}pitched whine, buzz or other disturbing noise until their drivers fasten their seat belts. Such a device realises a boolean function of two variables.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Simulation: The Monte Carlo method\}}
\NormalTok{In the quest to understand the many systems that comprise the modern world we turn increasingly to computer simulation. Whether the system is natural or artificial, frequently one or more of its components have such complex behaviour that the only feasible approach to approximating such behaviour is to assume that it is random.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Gödel\textquotesingle{}s Theorem: Limits on Logic\}}
\NormalTok{In the early 1930\textquotesingle{}s, Kurt Gödel, a German mathematician, attempted to show that predicate calculus was complete\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} {-} that one can obtain mechanically  (in principle, at least) a proof of any true formula expressed in that calculus. His failure to do this was crowned by the discovery that the task was impossible.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Can machines think?\}}
\NormalTok{Turing addressed the question \textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}Can machines think?\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} in his 1950 paper }\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}textit}\NormalTok{\{Computing machinery and intelligence\}.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{But what is LaTeX good for?\}}
\NormalTok{We\textquotesingle{}re using this }\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}LaTeX\textbackslash{} }\NormalTok{document to demonstrate some of its key strengths that you will find useful during and after University:}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{enumerate}\NormalTok{\}}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}item}\NormalTok{ LaTeX can quickly create pdf files}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}item}\NormalTok{ LaTeX uses professional typesetting}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}item}\NormalTok{ LaTeX documents can be more legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader than those created with word processing software}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{enumerate}\NormalTok{\}}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The text here is excerpted from \emph{The New Turing Ominbus: 66 excursions in Computer Science} \citep{turingomnibus}. The Omnibus is a lovely introduction to the fundamentals of Computer Science that you might enjoy. In his book review, the software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood}{Jeff Atwood} calls it an ``incredibly fun little book''. \citep{codinghorror}

\hypertarget{exercise-one-document}{%
\section{Exercise one: document}\label{exercise-one-document}}

In your file \texttt{turing.tex} either cut-and-paste this longer text into your document or make your own sections and text. You could use text from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum}{Lorem ipsum} at \href{https://www.lipsum.com}{lipsum.com} to fill out the page.

Now, at the top of your document after the \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{document\}} line and before first \texttt{\textbackslash{}section}, add the following commands, each on their own line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}title}\NormalTok{\{The New Turing Ominbus\}}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}author}\NormalTok{\{A. K. Dewdney\}}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}maketitle}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}tableofcontents}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}newpage}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{title}, \texttt{author}, \texttt{tableofcontents} and \texttt{newpage} commands are self-explanatory. The \texttt{maketitle} automatically inserts today's date. Your table of contents won't be created until you run pdflatex \textbf{twice} because on the first run, LaTeX gathers and stores information about what to put in the table of contents, and only creates it on the second run.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# remember to run pdflatex twice for the table of contents}
\NormalTok{pdlfatex turing.tex}
\NormalTok{pdflatex turing.tex}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{bold-italic-lists-and-quotes}{%
\section{Bold, italic, lists and quotes}\label{bold-italic-lists-and-quotes}}

Here's a few points to note about the text above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Notice how \textbf{bold} and \emph{italic} formatting are created using \texttt{\textbackslash{}textbf} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}textit}
\item
  Notice how lists are created using \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{enumerate\}} and \texttt{item}
\item
  Notice that curved open quotation marks (`` - looks like miniature 66) and close quotation marks ('' - looks like miniature 99) are different characters. Look carefully at the quotes around the phrase ``Can machines think?'' in the excerpt above in section \protect\hyperlink{longer}{longer}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{concsimple}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{concsimple}}

You've created a basic document in LaTeX and we've introduced some of its advntages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  LaTeX can quickly create pdf files
\item
  LaTeX uses professional typesetting
\item
  LaTeX documents can be more legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader that those created with word processing software
\end{itemize}

Next we'll look at adding some cross-references, figures and citations.

\hypertarget{figref}{%
\chapter{Cross referencing, illustrating and citing}\label{figref}}

LaTeX has simple but powerful tools to allow you to cross reference, illustrate and cite sources in your documents.

\hypertarget{cross-referencing}{%
\section{Cross referencing}\label{cross-referencing}}

LaTeX allows you to cross-reference almost anything in the document, which includes sections, sub-sections and figures. To use the cross-referencing feature you simply insert the command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}label\{mymarker\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

at the point in the document you want to refer to, and then use the command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}ref\{mymarker\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

when you want to use the reference. Obviously you replace the text \texttt{mymarker} with something more meaningful. An important tip here is to call the marker something that refers to the content of that part of the document, and to avoid the temptation to use numbers in case you re-order your document. For example, lets say we wanted to cross reference between sections:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}documentclass}\NormalTok{[a4paper]\{}\ExtensionTok{article}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Turing Machines: The Simplest Computers\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}label}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{sec:simplest}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{Turing machines are the simplest and most widely used theoretical models of computing. Far too slow and unwieldy ever to be embodied in a real device, these conceptual machines nevertheless seem to capture everything we mean by the term }\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}textit}\NormalTok{\{computation\}. No only do Turing machines occupy the top level of the Chomsky hierarchy, but they also seem capable of computing any function which is computable by any other conceptual scheme.}

\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}section}\NormalTok{\{Alan Turing\}}
\NormalTok{The Turing machines described in section }\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}ref}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{sec:simplest}\NormalTok{\} are named after Alan Turing.}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{illustrating-your-documents}{%
\section{Illustrating your documents}\label{illustrating-your-documents}}

A document without figures, images, pictures and graphs is pretty dull, so you'll want to illustrate your document with figures such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:turing-fig}, for example.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/Alan_Turing_Aged_16} 

}

\caption{Alan Turing at the age of sixteen, picture by unknown author, public domain, via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/oZx](https://w.wiki/oZx)}\label{fig:turing-fig}
\end{figure}

Including figures and pictures in your document is straightforward. You do it like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{figure}\NormalTok{\}}
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}includegraphics}\NormalTok{[width=10cm]\{}\ExtensionTok{images/turing.jpg}\NormalTok{\}}
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}caption}\NormalTok{\{Turing machines are named after Alan Turing\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}label}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{figure:turing}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}end}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{figure}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The command \texttt{\textbackslash{}includegraphics\{\}} gets your image, which can be PDF, PNG, JPG, GIF or PostScript. The \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{figure\}} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{figure\}} code wraps up whatever picture you're including, and allows LaTeX to treat it as an unbreakable floating thing that it will position for you as best it can in the document, while maintaining an overall nice typographical layout. This floating of figures can sometimes result in the figure ending up in a place you didn't expect, but in most cases LaTeX will make the most sensible choice. It's possible to employ finer control over figure placement, but that's beyond the scope of this guide.

The \texttt{\textbackslash{}includegraphics} command is not built in to core LaTeX but is in an additional package, which needs to be explicitly loaded. You can load this package by using the command \texttt{usepackage} in the document preamble, in between the \texttt{documentclass} and the \texttt{begin\ \{document\}}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}documentclass}\NormalTok{[a4paper]\{}\ExtensionTok{article}\NormalTok{\}}
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}usepackage}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{graphicx}\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{document}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{ex2}{%
\section{Exercise two: figures}\label{ex2}}

Create a document \texttt{image.tex}, that contains some text (maybe from Lorem Ipsum), together with a figure containing an image of your choice. Create a cross reference to the figure in the text.

\hypertarget{citations-and-footnotes}{%
\section{Citations and footnotes}\label{citations-and-footnotes}}

Footnotes\footnote{This is a footnote about footnotes. Very meta.} can be added to a document with \texttt{\textbackslash{}footnote\{\}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{\textbackslash{}footnote}\NormalTok{\{This is a footnote about footnotes\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can cite sources such as websites, books or journal articles in your document using the \texttt{\textbackslash{}cite} command.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}cite}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{turing}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The citations themselves can be stored in a separate \texttt{*.bib\ file} using a format called BibTeX. BibTeX provides citation types so books\footnote{Using tools like \url{https://www.ottobib.com} can help you to quickly generate BibTeX entries from a given ISBN number} using the \texttt{@book} type like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{@Book\{turingomnibus,}
\NormalTok{  title = \{The New Turing Omnibus: Sixty{-}six excursions in Computer Science\},}
\NormalTok{  author = \{A. K. Dewdney\},}
\NormalTok{  publisher = \{Henry Holt\},}
\NormalTok{  address = \{New York\},}
\NormalTok{  year = \{2001\},}
\NormalTok{  isbn = \{9780805071665\},}
\NormalTok{  url = \{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources?isbn=978{-}0805071665\}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and articles\footnote{BibTeX entries for journal articles can be automatically generated from persistent identifiers known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier}{digital object identifiers} or doi's, see \url{https://doi2bib.org} for example. This saves you the unpleasant task of typing them in by hand.} use the \texttt{@article} type like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{@article\{turing,}
\NormalTok{  doi = \{10.1112/plms/s2{-}42.1.230\},}
\NormalTok{  url = \{https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2{-}42.1.230\},}
\NormalTok{  year = \{1937\},}
\NormalTok{  publisher = \{Wiley\},}
\NormalTok{  volume = \{s2{-}42\},}
\NormalTok{  number = \{1\},}
\NormalTok{  pages = \{230{-}{-}265\},}
\NormalTok{  author = \{Alan Turing\},}
\NormalTok{  title = \{On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\},}
\NormalTok{  journal = \{Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society\}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For everything else you can use the \texttt{@misc} type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{@misc\{googlescholar,}
\NormalTok{  author       = \{Anon\},}
\NormalTok{  title        = \{Alan Turing Google Scholar page\},}
\NormalTok{  url          = \{https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=VWCHlwkAAAAJ\},}
\NormalTok{  year         = \{2020\},}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we wanted to create the text:

``You can find Turing's publications in Google scholar. \citep{googlescholar}
His paper on the Entscheidungsproblem was published in 1937. \citep{turing}
He wrote about thinking machines in 1950. \citep{turing50}''

We would need the following in our tex file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{You can find Turing\textquotesingle{}s publications in Google scholar. }\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}cite}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{googlescholar}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{His paper on the Entscheidungsproblem was published in 1937. }\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}cite}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{turing}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{He wrote about thinking machines in 1950. }\KeywordTok{\textbackslash{}cite}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{turing50}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To generate the bibliography you'll need to add these two lines

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}bibliographystyle}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{natbib}\NormalTok{\}}
\BuiltInTok{\textbackslash{}bibliography}\NormalTok{\{}\ExtensionTok{latex}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and when you compile you need to run pdflatex before and after running bibtex.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pdflatex turing.tex}
\NormalTok{bibtex turing.bib}
\NormalTok{pdflatex turing.tex}
\NormalTok{pdflatex turing.tex}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you find all the typing at the command line tedious, you could write a little bash script to automate this simple workflow including opening pdf when it is created.

\hypertarget{fingconc}{%

You have cross referenced, illustrated and added citations and footnotes to your document. Next we'll look at doing some maths.

(This chapters uses mathematics, if you can't see the equations and matrix below in your web browser, you'll need to use the pdf version of this document at \href{https://latex4year1.netlify.app/latex4year1.pdf}{latex4year1.netlify.app/latex4year1.pdf}. Otherwise, read on below.)

LaTeX provides powerful tools for typesetting mathematics, such as this equation:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \]

To render the equation above, you include this in your tex file:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
     \SpecialStringTok{\textbackslash{}[ x = }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}frac}\SpecialStringTok{\{{-}b }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}pm}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}sqrt}\SpecialStringTok{\{b\^{}2{-}4ac\}\}\{2a\} \textbackslash{}]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{equations}{%
\section{Equations}\label{equations}}

You can probably work out how most of this creates the formula, but it won't be obvious that the \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| symbols that enclose the formula mean typeset this as a displayed formula, giving it some vertical space from the surrounding text. If we'd used \texttt{\textbackslash{}(} and \texttt{\textbackslash{})} instead to enclose the formula it would appear in-line, like this: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\). It still looks very nice, and observe how it's automatically been resized to fit, and that the lines of text have had their spacing changed a bit. This all looks simple, but the implementation inside LaTeX and TeX is complex. It involves parsing the description of the formula to create a corresponding tree data structure, which is then recursively walked to work out the horizontal and vertical typographical spacings needed. You'll meet these ideas in \href{https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP11120/syllabus/}{COMP11120 Mathematical Techniques for Computer Science} in your first year and \href{https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP26120/syllabus/}{COMP26120 Algorithms and Imperative Programming} in your second year.

Here's another example, taken from computer graphics, it's a local illumination model incorporating ambient, diffuse and specular reflection by multiple lights:

\[ I = k_a I_a + \sum_{i=1}^M {\frac{{I_p}_i}{d'_i}} [ k_d(\hat{N}\cdot\hat{L_i}) + k_s(\hat{R_i}\cdot\hat{V})^n] \]

We write this in LaTeX as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
    \SpecialStringTok{\textbackslash{}[ I = k\_a I\_a + }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}sum}\SpecialStringTok{\_\{i=1\}\^{}M \{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}frac}\SpecialStringTok{\{\{I\_p\}\_i\}\{d\textquotesingle{}\_i\} \}}
\SpecialStringTok{    [ k\_d(}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}hat}\SpecialStringTok{\{N\} }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}cdot}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}hat}\SpecialStringTok{\{L\_i\})}
\SpecialStringTok{    + k\_s(}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}hat}\SpecialStringTok{\{R\_i\} }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}cdot}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}hat}\SpecialStringTok{\{V\})\^{}n] \textbackslash{}]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Try to match the LaTeX commands with the formula displayed above. You'll see lots of curly brackets, and this example illustrates their two uses in LaTeX. The first is to provide an argument to a command; for example \texttt{\textbackslash{}hat\{N\}} means apply the \texttt{\textbackslash{}hat} command to \(N\)', which creates \(\hat{N}\), the vector \(N\) with a little hat on.

The second use of curly brackets is to group things together to avoid ambiguities. In the example you can see \(\sum_{i=1}^M\), which creates a summation sign and its lower and upper limits: \(\sum_{i=1}^{M}\). We wrap the lower bound, \texttt{i=1} in curly brackets to group it into an indivisible unit. If we were to omit the brackets, writing \texttt{\textbackslash{}sum\_i=1\^{}M}, LaTeX would then produce \(\sum_i=1^M\), which is not at all what we want (even LaTeX can't always know what we really want).

\hypertarget{matrices}{%
\section{Matrices}\label{matrices}}

If we need to use matrix, such as the one below which expresses a particular 3D geometrical transformation

\[ T_1 = \left[
 \begin{array}{cccc}
 \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 & \delta \\
 \sin \theta  & \cos \theta & 0 & \epsilon \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & \eta \\
 \alpha & \beta & \gamma & 1
 \end{array}
 \right] \]

we can use the following

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
   \SpecialStringTok{\textbackslash{}[ T\_1 = }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}left}\SpecialStringTok{[}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}begin}\SpecialStringTok{\{array\}\{cccc\}}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}cos}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}theta}\SpecialStringTok{ \& {-}}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}sin}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}theta}\SpecialStringTok{ \& 0 \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}delta}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}sin}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}theta}\SpecialStringTok{  \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}cos}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}theta}\SpecialStringTok{ \& 0 \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}epsilon}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}
\SpecialStringTok{    0 \& 0 \& 1 \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}eta}\SpecialStringTok{ }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}alpha}\SpecialStringTok{ \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}beta}\SpecialStringTok{ \& }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}gamma}\SpecialStringTok{ \& 1}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}end}\SpecialStringTok{\{array\}}
\SpecialStringTok{    }\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}right}\SpecialStringTok{] \textbackslash{}]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the LaTeX code, \texttt{\textbackslash{}left{[}} means `big opening square bracket please'; \texttt{\{cccc\}} means `an array with 4 columns please, with the items in each column centred'; \texttt{\&} means `start a new column'; and \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} means `start a new row'. You'll notice that LaTeX knows about greek letters; it knows about most standard maths symbols too, and also the ways they're usually used.

There are some symbols that you might need (for example \texttt{\textbackslash{}therefore}, which produces the usual three dots symbol ∴) that are not part of standard LaTeX. Many such symbols are provided by the \texttt{amssymb} package of symbols compiled by the American Mathematical Society. Details of the many symbols provided by this package can be found online. To use these extra symbols, you need to have \texttt{\textbackslash{}usepackage\{amssymb\}} in your document preamble.

LaTeX really shines at typesetting mathematics, we've really only scratched the surface here. For more have a look at
\href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics}{en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics} or books such as the \emph{Guide to LaTeX} by Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly. \citep{kopka}

\hypertarget{exercise-three-maths}{%
\section{Exercise three: maths}\label{exercise-three-maths}}

Now for an exercise that involves some mathematics. Create a file \texttt{maths.tex} which typesets the following piece of text and mathematics:

There are many positive integer solutions to the equation

\[ x^2 + y^2 =  z^2 \]

which can be rewritten as

\[ z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

For example \((3,4, 5)\) or \((5,12,13)\). Such solutions are called \emph{Pythagorean triples}.

However, for higher powers the situation is very different, and we have:-

\textbf{Theorem: Fermat-Wiles}
For all natural numbers \(n ≥ 3\), there are no integers \(x,y,z\) satisfying the equation:

\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]

\hypertarget{mathconc}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{mathconc}}

We've briefly looked at typesetting mathematics in LaTeX with some equations and a matrix. LaTeX can do a lot more maths than equations and matrices but this has given you a flavour of what it can do. In the next chapter we'll look at collaborative authoring and editing in the cloud with overleaf.

\hypertarget{overleaf}{%
\chapter{Collaborative editing with overleaf}\label{overleaf}}

If you are the sole author of a document, then compiling files on your local machine is fine. However, if you need to collaboratively co-author a document with other people, you'll need to share your TeX on a server. Overleaf (\href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{overleaf.com}) allows you to do this, and is shown in the screenshot in Figure \ref{fig:overleaf-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Overleaf_v2_editing_page} 

}

\caption{A screenshot of overleaf showing the source TeX on the left and side and the corresponding pdf on the right hand side. Screen shot by Dan Cherniy via Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/omo](https://w.wiki/omo)}\label{fig:overleaf-fig}
\end{figure}

Overleaf has several features which you might find useful:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your documents are saved the cloud
\item
  Packages, class files, compilers and other LaTeX components are also in the cloud, saving you time installing and managing software
\item
  Templates are provided for common types of documents
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exercise-four-overleaf}{%
\section{Exercise four: overleaf}\label{exercise-four-overleaf}}

Overleaf exercise:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Login to \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{overleaf.com}\\
\item
  Create and save a simple document using an overleaf tutorial\footnote{\url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Creating_a_document_in_Overleaf}}~\\
\item
  Note that overleaf allows you to store your TeX source in a git repository so you can use version control
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{overleafconc}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{overleafconc}}

Overleaf is a handy tool for creating LaTeX documents. While LaTeX is a mature and established system for typesetting that has been around since 1980's, \citep{knuth} overleaf brings it up to date with a convenient cloud based interface. In the next chapter we will create a curriculum vitae using document templates provided by overleaf.

\hypertarget{cv}{%
\chapter{Your curriculum vitae}\label{cv}}

You'll write many documents at University, but there is one document that is \textbf{really} important in a potentially life-changing way. Your curriculum vitae\footnote{strictly speaking it should be vitæ (not vitae) if you're being pedantic} or resume. An example CV is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cv-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/jake-ryan} 

}

\caption{An example CV using an overleaf template. Would you invite Jake to interview based on his CV? These are the kinds of decisions that are made based on your CV. There are many other CV templates available, this one is by Jake Gutierrez and published under an MIT license at [overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)}\label{fig:cv-fig}
\end{figure}

Creating a professional looking CV is especially important, because it determines if you are invited to interview for opportunities you are applying for. The decision to interview is typically based on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how your CV looks, the typesetting, layout and style (typography)
\item
  the content of your CV, what you've done and how you describe it
\item
  the quality and clarity of your written communication
\item
  the editing, what you've decided to leave in (and leave out) of your CV
\end{itemize}

By opportunities we mean both immediate ones within the next 12 months as well as those further in the future. These opportunities might include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spring insights during easter next year\footnote{see the essential guide to student insights at \url{https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights}} some of which have application deadlines before Christmas
\item
  Summer internships next year or during subsequent summers\footnote{see where can I look for jobs? \url{https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/search}}
\item
  Year long placements in your penultimate year, if you're considering doing \href{http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/}{industrial experience}
\item
  Graduate jobs or graduate schemes
\item
  Postgraduate study or research via masters or PhD
\end{itemize}

So it is well worth investing a bit of your time to create version 1.0 of your CV. Yes, you've only just started University but it's never too early to make a start.

\hypertarget{exercise-five-your-cv}{%
\section{Exercise five: your CV}\label{exercise-five-your-cv}}

Create a basic CV which tells your story including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your education, including high school and University
\item
  your experience, voluntary, paid, casual, technical and non-technical work
\item
  your projects, both personal or at University and beyond
\end{itemize}

You can do this using the ready-made templates at \href{https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv}{overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv}

\hypertarget{debug-your-cv}{%
\section{Debug your CV}\label{debug-your-cv}}

As you progress through University, keep your CV up to date, and continuously get feedback from as many people as you can. There will be opportunities to debug your CV later, but you'll need a ``beta release'' (version 1.0) of your CV to get started. The best time to start debugging is now, so that you can squash any bugs before employers see them. Here's some common bugs we have seen in students CVs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear?
\item
  Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don't just rely on a spellchecker, they can't detect everything
\item
  Does it look good, decent layout, easy on the eye?
\item
  Does it fit comfortably on one page (preferably) or two pages only?
\item
  Is it in reverse chronological order? Are the most important (usually recent) things first?
\item
  Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent verbs, rather than just what you know? See \href{http://git.io/verbsfirst}{git.io/verbsfirst} for examples
\item
  Have you mentioned things you are studying now and throughout the current academic year, not just courses you have finished?
\item
  Have you quantified and provided evidence for the claims you make?
\item
  Is your CV robot proof? Many large employers use automated applicant tracking systems where your CV is screened by software long before a human ever sees it. Feed it through software like \href{http://careerset.io/manchester}{careerset.io/manchester} and \href{https://resume.io/}{resume.io}, what feedback do the robots give you? How can you make your CV more robot proof?
\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{cvconc}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{cvconc}}

Your curriculum vitae is a \emph{really} important document and it will most likely take many iterations to get it right. We recommend you start working on it sooner rather than later and get feedback from as many different people (and bots) as you reasonably can. We hope you enjoy using LaTeX to create professional documents for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your individual COMP101 coursework (see blackboard)
\item
  your CV / resume
\item
  your third year project dissertation. It might seem a long way off now but it comes around very quickly!
\end{itemize}

\ldots and more.
