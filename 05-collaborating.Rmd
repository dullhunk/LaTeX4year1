# Collaborative editing with overleaf {#overleaf}

If you are the sole author of a document, then compiling files on your local machine is fine. However, if you need to collaboratively co-author a document with other people, you'll need to share your TeX on a server. Overleaf ([overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)) allows you to do this, and is shown in the screenshot in Figure \@ref(fig:overleaf-fig).

```{r overleaf-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap='A screenshot of overleaf showing the source TeX on the left hand side and the corresponding pdf on the right hand side. Screenshot by Dan Cherniy via Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/omo](https://w.wiki/omo)'}

Compared to LaTeX, overleaf is relatively new, the company responsible was founded in 2013. It has several features which you might find useful:

* Your documents are automatically saved the cloud
* Packages, class files, compilers and other LaTeX components are also in the cloud, saving you time installing and managing software
* Templates are provided for common types of documents

## Summary {#overleafconc}

Overleaf provides a modern and convenient cloud based interface to tried and tested LaTeX tools, which have been around for over thirty years. [@knuth] It also allows you to share the source of your documents while providing some handy templates for common document types. Which toolset is “best” for you will largely depend on what kind of documents you are working on. In the next chapter we will create a curriculum vitae using CV templates provided by overleaf.
