# Welcome {-}

Hello and welcome to the LaTeX lab manual, part of [COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/) at the University of Manchester.

```{r latexproject-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap='(ref:captionlatex)'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/1000px-LaTeX_project_logo_bird.svg.png")
```

Reading this LaTeX manual and doing the five exercises it contains will enable you to develop your written communication skills so that you can:

1. Create a simple document in pdf using LaTeX
1. Illustrate a document with figures and cross references
1. Typeset some mathematics
1. Share and collaborate on LaTeX documents using overleaf
1. Draft a CV using LaTeX templates
