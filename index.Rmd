# Welcome {-}

Hello and welcome to the LaTeX lab manual, part of COMP101 at the University of Manchester.

```{r latexproject-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap='The LaTeX project logo, image by Jonas Jacek CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/oZs](https://w.wiki/oZs)'}

```
Reading this LaTeX manual and doing the five exercises it contains will enable you to develop your written communication skills so that you can:

1. Create a simple document in pdf using LaTeX
1. Illustrate a document with figures and cross references
1. Typeset some mathematics
1. Share and collaborate on LaTeX documents using overleaf
1. Draft a CV using LaTeX templates in overleaf
