# Collaborative editing with overleaf {#overleaf}

If you are the sole author of a document, then compiling files on your local machine is fine. However, if you need to collaboratively co-author a document with other people, you'll need to share your TeX on a server. Overleaf ([overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)) allows you to do this, and is shown in the screenshot in Figure \@ref(fig:overleaf-fig).

```{r overleaf-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap='A screenshot of overleaf showing the source TeX on the left and side and the corresponding pdf on the right hand side. Screen shot by Dan Cherniy via Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/omo](https://w.wiki/omo)'}

```

Overleaf has several features which you might find useful:

* Your documents are saved the cloud
* Packages, class files, compilers and other LaTeX components are also in the cloud, saving you time installing and managing software
* Templates are provided for common types of documents

## Summary {#overleafconc}

Overleaf is a handy tool for creating LaTeX documents. While LaTeX is a mature and established typesetting system that has been around since 1980's, [@knuth] overleaf brings it up to date with a convenient cloud based interface. In the next chapter we will create a curriculum vitae using CV templates provided by overleaf.
