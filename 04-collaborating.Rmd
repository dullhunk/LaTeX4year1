# Collaborative editing with overleaf {#overleaf}

If you are the sole author of a document, then compiling files on your local machine is fine. However, if you need to collaboratively co-author a document with other people, you'll need to share your TeX on a server. Overleaf ([overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)) allows you to do this, and is shown in the screenshot in Figure \@ref(fig:overleaf-fig).

```{r overleaf-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap='A screenshot of overleaf showing the source TeX on the left and side and the corresponding pdf on the right hand side'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Overleaf_v2_editing_page.jpg")
```

Overleaf has two features which are useful

* Your documents are saved the cloud
* Packages, class files and compilers are also in the cloud, saving you time installing things
* Templates are provided for common types of documents
