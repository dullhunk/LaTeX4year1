# What is LaTeX? {#latex}

LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. [@latexproject] LaTeX is a mature and established typesetting system that has been around since 1980's. [@knuth] It is most often used for technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing, including writing CVs and formal letters. Whatever you create with LaTeX, one of its key strengths is making documents look professional in portable document format (pdf) using industrial-strength typesetting.

## Not a word processor
LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages you to concentrate on the content of your documents, while it takes care of many of the details of its presentation. This is similar to the approach you've been using for creating web pages where the style (CSS) is separated from the content (HTML).

Unlike most word processors, LaTex is **not** a WYSIWYG system (what you see is what you get). The raw document you edit (a `*.tex` file) is not your final output (usually a `*.pdf` file).

## So what is LaTeX then?

The best way to understand LaTeX is to create some documents which we'll do in the next chapter.
